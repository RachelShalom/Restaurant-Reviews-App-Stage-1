# Restaurant Reviews Project
---

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This is a udacity project: **Restaurant Reviews** where I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I  also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### How to use this Project?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3001` For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 3001`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3001`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.It will be great to get your feedback:)
